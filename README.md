Reinforcement Learning on BTC/USD

This project applies Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the BTC/USD trading market, aiming to create an agent that can learn to make profitable trading decisions (Buy, Sell, Hold) based on historical market data and technical indicators such as RSI, SMA_10, and MACD. The RL agent maximizes cumulative rewards by optimizing its trading strategy over time, and is evaluated through backtesting against historical data.
